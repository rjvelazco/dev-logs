In this tutorial, Iâ€™ll walk you through how to set up Browsersync with [Gulp](https://coder-coder.com/gulp-4-walk-through/) in a basic front-end workflow.

Weâ€™ll be working with HTML, Sass and JavaScript files, and create this fancy shmancy website! ðŸ˜„

[Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/)Â is a powerful tool that enables you to test your website in real time. It works by spinning up a local server and syncing it up to your browser.

Then, anytime you make a change in your code or files, it will reload the browser to update it immediately.

Using Browsersync will help you code faster and more efficiently. Itâ€™s an incredibly helpful tool that any web developer should know how to use.

Setting up the project
----------------------

Want to code along with this tutorial? I created aÂ [GitHub repo](https://github.com/thecodercoder/gulp-browsersync)Â that contains all the starter files for this project.

Either clone or download the GitHub repo, and open the folder in your favorite code editor (I like VS Code, personally).

Hereâ€™s a rundown of the project structure and what types of files we have:

```bash
[gulp-browsersync]
  |-- [app]
    |-- [js]
            |-- script.js
    |-- [scss]
            |-- style.scss
  |-- [dist]
  |-- [img]
  |-- gulpfile.js
  |-- index.html
  |-- package-lock.json
  |-- package.json
```

In the project root we have ourÂ `index.html`,Â `package.json`,Â `package-lock.json`, andÂ `gulpfile.js`Â files.

And we have some folders:Â `app`,Â `dist`, andÂ `img`.

In theÂ `app`Â folder we have aÂ `js`Â subfolder, containing theÂ `script.js`Â file.

And we have anÂ `scss`Â subfolder with theÂ `style.scss`Â file. Weâ€™re keeping things minimal here, with just a single JavaScript and SCSS file.

TheÂ `dist`Â folder is where we will put our compiled CSS and JavaScript files. And theÂ `img`Â folder is for our background image.

Configuring Gulp
----------------

Letâ€™s install the npm packages that weâ€™ll need, and take a look at our Gulp workflow.

### Installing packages and importing modules

To install the packages, open a terminal or command line window and navigate to the project directory.

Then runÂ `npm install`Â to install the packages listed in theÂ `package.json`file. Iâ€™d also recommend runningÂ `npm update`Â afterwards to make sure you are using the newest versions of each package. Just because the versions I have in the GitHub repo will get out of date as time goes on.

Once you have everything installed, letâ€™s take a look at our gulpfile.

Importing modules
-----------------

First off, we are importing the npm packages that we installed as modules. This enables us to access the package functions in our Gulp tasks. Hereâ€™s what that looks like in the code:


```js
const { src, dest, watch, series } = require('gulp');
const sass = require('gulp-sass');
const postcss = require('gulp-postcss');
const cssnano = require('cssnano');
const terser = require('gulp-terser');
const browsersync = require('browser-sync').create();
```  

At the top, we are importing some Gulp functions:Â `src`,Â `dest`,Â `watch`, andÂ `series`.

Then we are loading the other packages:

*   `gulp-sass`, which compiles Sass files to CSS
*   `gulp-postcss`Â and theÂ `cssnano`Â plugin, which minify the final CSS file
*   `gulp-terser`, which minifies our JavaScript file
*   `browser-sync`, which runs and syncs a local server to our website files

Weâ€™re keeping the workflow in this project minimal since the focus is on Browsersync.

> I also have an in-depthÂ [Gulp course](https://coder-coder.com/gulp-course/)Â covering a more customized workflow!

Now, letâ€™s take a look at the different Gulp tasks weâ€™ve configured in our gulpfile.

### Sass task

The first task is our Sass task:

```js
// Sass Task
function scssTask(){
    return src('app/scss/style.scss', { sourcemaps: true })
        .pipe(sass())
        .pipe(postcss([cssnano()]))
        .pipe(dest('dist', { sourcemaps: '.' }));
}
``` 

This function will take theÂ `style.scss`Â file, compile it to CSS using theÂ `sass()`Â function, then use PostCSS to minify the file withÂ `cssnano()`, and finally save the resulting CSS file in theÂ `dist`Â folder. Weâ€™re also creating a sourcemap file so you can see where in the Sass file each style rule comes from.

### JavaScript task

The next task is our JavaScript task:

```js
// JavaScript Task
function jsTask(){
    return src('app/js/script.js', { sourcemaps: true })
        .pipe(terser())
        .pipe(dest('dist', { sourcemaps: '.' }));
}
```

This function takes theÂ `script.js`Â file and minifies it usingÂ `terser()`, then saves the resulting file in theÂ `dist`Â folder. It also will create a sourcemap file. Weâ€™re not doing anything more advanced like bundling, just assuming that weâ€™re working with vanilla JavaScript here.

Letâ€™s move on to the Browsersync section now!

Adding Browsersync to your Gulpfile
-----------------------------------

In our gulpfile, we initially imported Browsersync as a JavaScript constant with this line:Â `const browsersync = require('browser-sync').create();`. TheÂ `create()`Â function, as the name implies,Â [creates a Browsersync instance](https://www.browsersync.io/docs/api#api-create)Â that we can then use to run our local server.

We can then create our Browsersync tasks!

### BrowsersyncServe task

Our first task,Â `browsersyncServe`, will initialize the local server:

```js
function browsersyncServe(cb){
    browsersync.init({
        server: {
            baseDir: '.'
        }    
    });
    cb();
}
```  

It runs theÂ `browsersync.init()`Â function which launches the local server, using theÂ `baseDir`Â server option. In our case, we want to setÂ `baseDir`Â toÂ `'.'`. This indicates that the local server will launch the website from the same directory as the gulpfile is in.

Since both theÂ `index.html`Â file and the gulpfile are in the project root, we want the website to run from the same location.

If youâ€™re wondering what theÂ `cb`Â parameter is, itâ€™s a callback function. In Gulp, all tasks are asynchronous JavaScript functions, so if a function isnâ€™t returning anything, we have to use the callback to explicitly signify that the function is complete.

Both our Browsersync Gulp tasks are not returning a stream like the other tasks, so they both have callbacks. You can read more about callbacks and asynchronous functions in Gulp in theirÂ [documentation](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/async-completion/).

TheÂ `browsersyncServe`Â task will start the server, but we also want to automatically reload the browser when we make code changes.

### BrowsersyncReload task

To reload the server, we have another task,Â `browsersyncReload`Â which will do just that:

```js
function browsersyncReload(cb){
    browsersync.reload();
    cb();
}
```

Itâ€™s a pretty basic functionâ€“ the only thing it does is runÂ `browsersync.reload()`Â to tell Browsersync to reload the local website.

Now that we have our Browsersync tasks set up, letâ€™s integrate them into our Gulp workflow!

Adding Browsersync to Gulp tasks
--------------------------------

### Default task

In our default Gulp task, weâ€™re going to run all the tasks that we want to execute once when we first runÂ `gulp`Â on the command line.

```js
// Default Gulp Task
exports.default = series(
    scssTask,
    jsTask,
    browsersyncServe,
    watchTask
);
```

As you can see in the code, weâ€™re running our Sass and JavaScript tasks, then initializing the Browsersync server, and finally running our watch task.

### Watch task

The watch task will monitor our files and run the necessary tasks when it detects code changes.

```js
// Watch Task
function watchTask(){
    watch('*.html', browsersyncReload);
    watch(['app/**/*.scss', 'app/**/*.js'], series(scssTask, jsTask, browsersyncReload));
}
```
      

We are doing two things in our watch task:

*   Watch any HTML files and runÂ `browsersyncReload`Â after any changes
*   Watch any Sass or JavaScript files and run the Sass task, JavaScript task, and thenÂ `browsersyncReload`Â after any changes

I kept them separate because I didnâ€™t want to run the Sass and JavaScript tasks when weâ€™ve only updated the HTML file. Of course, you can re-run every task when the HTML is changedâ€“ it will just take a bit longer.
